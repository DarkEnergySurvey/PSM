PSM v_DC4 (22 Jul 2009)
-----------------------
1.  Changed reference to objects table from OBJECTS_ALL to OBJECTS to 
    reflect update in database schema (JIRA issue DES-825).


PSM v_DC4 (13 Oct 2008)
-----------------------

1.  Added PhotomEqSolverRunDC4, PhotomEqSolverDC4, ColorTermCoeffs, and
    DESDMFile classes.
    a. Support for new DES database tables.
    b. Support for Y-band.
    c. Support for a per-CCD fixed value of the instrumental color term 
       coefficient ("b").
    d. Support for accessing $HOME_DIR/.desdm file.
    e. New intermediate verbosity levels of output to screen/log for PSM.

2.  Updated MatchedStdStar class to include support for Y-band.
    a. Backwards compatibility for PhotomEqSolverRun2b, PhotomEqSolverRun2b. 

3.  Updated default psmParam*.par files.
    a. Renamed old default psmParam_bcs_*.par files to 
         psmParam_preDC4_bcs_*.par.
    b. Created new default psmParam_bcs_*.par files that are compliant
         with PhotomEqSolverRunDC4 (but are also backwards-compatible with
         PhotomEqSolverRun2b)
    c. Created new default psmParam_des_*.par files for use with DES DC4
         simulations.

4.  Removed extraneous *.java and *.class files in 
    $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/trunk/lib/gov/fnal/eag/dtucker/desPhotoStds

5.  Updated $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/doc/README

6.  Added $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/doc/RELEASENOTES

7.  Added setup script for bash ($DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/bin/setup.bash) 
    in addition to the original setup script for tcsh 
    ($DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/bin/setup.csh).
