PSM v_Year1 (4 Dec 2012)
------------------------

1.  Updated for fPhotoStdsMatch2.
    a. Added standard_set_in as a global variable.
    b. Added standard_set_in as a comand-line option.

2.  Added u-band support.

3.  Added standard star color range command-line options, stdColorLo and 
    stdColorHi.

4.  Changed name of PSM results file from psmfitInput.fits to 
    psmfitInput_$nite$filter.fits.

5.  Changed object_id, image_id, and exposure_id from int's to long's.



PSM v_DC6 (23 Aug 2009)
----------------------

1.  Updated format of the jdbc URL to accommodate access to the new cluster 
    database.

2.  Added a command-line option ("--skipQAPlots") to skip the generation of 
    the QA plots (JIRA issue DES-2330).

3.  Made DECam focal plane the default option for the mag residuals vs. 
    x,y position on the focal plane QA plot (JIRA issue DES-2329).

4.  Changed all references to/queries for X_IMAGE,Y_IMAGE (which have been
    dropped in the IMAGE table in the new cluster database) to references to/
    queries for XWIN_IMAGE,YWIN_IMAGE.  (This really only affects the mag
    residuals vs. x,y position on the focal plane QA plot, and only 
    marginally, and XWIN_IMAGE,YWIN_IMAGE were probably preferable to begin
    with.)

5.  Commented out url and dbName in the psmParam_des_*.par files.  Although
    these parameters can be used in these parameter files, it is probably
    better to obtain them from the .desdm file.  The url and dbName have 
    not been commented out from the psmParam_bcs_*.par and 
    psmParam_preDC4_bcs_*.par files, however.
  
6. (3 Sep 2011):  Included a new QA output -- a QA table that includes
   the data that goes into the creation of the residual plots.  This table
   also includes exposure_id (which is not currently part of the QA plot
   output).



PSM v_DC5 (2 Oct 2009)
----------------------

1.  Updated default psmParam.par files for database's new domain name 
    (JIRA Issue DES-1118).

2.  Implemented the option and ability to use different types of magnitudes
    (mag_aper_x, mag_psf, mag_model) for the instrumental magnitude in the 
    fit to the photometric equation (JIRA issue DES-1100).

3.  Implemented the option and ability to output results to a FITS binary
    table rather than directly ingesting results into the PSMFIT table
    in the database (JIRA issue DES-1063).

4.  Implemented the option and ability to exclude a list of imageid's from the
    fit to the photometric equation.  This list is passed to the PSM via the
    command line.  Also, added a QA plot that shows residuals vs. imageid 
    number. (JIRA issue DES-1140) 

5.  Implemented code to find the range of mjds of the observations used in 
    the fit and uses this information to fill in the mjdLo and mjdHi 
    parameters in the PSMFIT table (these parameters had always been just 
    set to "-1" until now.)  The mjd's are taken from the mjd_obs parameter
    in the EXPOSURES table.  If this is not set, the values for mjdLo and 
    mjdHi revert to "-1" as before.  Also, added a QA plot that shows 
    residuals vs. mjd during the night.  (No JIRA issue)

5.  Added a new QA plot showing residuals vs. position (in pixels) on the 
    focal plane. (JIRA issue DES-921).



PSM v_DC4 (22 Jul 2009)
-----------------------

1.  Changed reference to objects table from OBJECTS_ALL to OBJECTS to 
    reflect update in database schema (JIRA issue DES-825).



PSM v_DC4 (13 Oct 2008)
-----------------------

1.  Added PhotomEqSolverRunDC4, PhotomEqSolverDC4, ColorTermCoeffs, and
    DESDMFile classes.
    a. Support for new DES database tables.
    b. Support for Y-band.
    c. Support for a per-CCD fixed value of the instrumental color term 
       coefficient ("b").
    d. Support for accessing $HOME_DIR/.desdm file.
    e. New intermediate verbosity levels of output to screen/log for PSM.

2.  Updated MatchedStdStar class to include support for Y-band.
    a. Backwards compatibility for PhotomEqSolverRun2b, PhotomEqSolverRun2b. 

3.  Updated default psmParam*.par files.
    a. Renamed old default psmParam_bcs_*.par files to 
         psmParam_preDC4_bcs_*.par.
    b. Created new default psmParam_bcs_*.par files that are compliant
         with PhotomEqSolverRunDC4 (but are also backwards-compatible with
         PhotomEqSolverRun2b)
    c. Created new default psmParam_des_*.par files for use with DES DC4
         simulations.

4.  Removed extraneous *.java and *.class files in 
    $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/trunk/lib/gov/fnal/eag/dtucker/desPhotoStds

5.  Updated $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/doc/README

6.  Added $DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/doc/RELEASENOTES

7.  Added setup script for bash ($DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/bin/setup.bash) 
    in addition to the original setup script for tcsh 
    ($DESPHOTOSTDSMOD_HOME/bin/setup.csh).
